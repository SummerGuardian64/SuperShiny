# Super Shiny – Licensing

This repository contains two main parts:

1. **SSGE (Summer Shiny Game Engine)** – the engine code (reusable).
2. **Super Shiny the game** – game logic, art, music, assets, and content.

They are licensed differently.

## 1. SSGE Engine License (zlib)

All engine code located under:

- `Source/ssge/`

is licensed under the **zlib/libpng license**, similar to SDL2.

## 2. Super Shiny Game & Assets License

All **game code and content**, including but not limited to:

- `Source/SuperShiny/`
- Any `Assets/`, `Music/`, `Backgrounds/`, `Tilesets/`, sprites, 3D models,
  sounds, graphics, logo, story, characters (including “Shiny”), level data,

are **NOT** open-source and are **not** covered by the zlib license above.

### You ARE allowed to:

- **Play** and enjoy the game.
- **Make fan works** (fanart, fanfiction, memes, etc.).
- **Create mods** or custom levels **for personal use** or free distribution,
  as long as:
  - You clearly credit *Super Shiny* and Summer Guardian 64.
  - You do not bundle or redistribute the game’s original assets in a way
    that replaces the original download.
- **Stream or record** gameplay (YouTube, Twitch, etc.), monetized or not.
- **Use snippets of code for learning**, security research, or educational
  purposes, with proper attribution.

### You are NOT allowed to:

- Sell the game, or sell modified/forked versions of the game, without
  my **explicit written permission**.
- Redistribute the game or assets in a way that makes it a replacement for
  the official builds (e.g. rehosting full ZIPs and claiming them as yours).
- Claim authorship of the original game, characters, art, or music.
- Use the characters, art, or assets in other commercial products without
  a separate written agreement.

If you want to make something commercial that is directly based on
*Super Shiny* or its assets, please contact me to discuss permissions.

## 3. Third-Party Libraries

Super Shiny uses third-party libraries such as **SDL2**, **SDL2_image**,
**SDL2_ttf**, and **SDL2_mixer**, which are licensed under their own terms
(typically zlib/libpng).

Those licenses apply to the respective libraries and are not overridden
by this file. Please refer to their documentation for details.
